Sublime Text Emmet Snippets
===========================

I created shortcuts for a basic HTML5 skeleton layout (with Emmet installed you just type “!” and hit tab) that includes basic features for SEO and accessibility: title, meta description, meta keywords, a canonical link, semantic elements, WAI roles etc.

Additionally features shortcuts for things I always forget (how exactly to code a click-to-call link) and images feature placeholder alt=“” attributes.
